                            <p>Virtual reality and augmented reality are taking ground with the retail 
                                sector, according to recent research conducted by ICX Association. The 
                                report shows a clear upward trend, with the value of this technology in the
                                retail sector estimated to reach $1.6 billion by 2025.

                                The IoT market was valued at more than $94 billion by the same report, so 
                                itâ€™s no surprise that the retail sector would adopt and benefit from this 
                                technology. Walmart and Target are pioneering the field by using and investing 
                                in emerging technologies to grow their businesses.</p>
